Sprint 1 was a time of trial and error and getting our project off the ground. Based on our feedback, here are the things our group will change in terms of process aspects.

1. Increase coverage (branches / lines) - we will work on making sure all of our code has been properly covered by cobuterra. 
2. Focus on TDD - we will continue to make test driven development a priority and make sure our tests are created and pushed prior to anything else.
3. Gitflow - we will make sure to follow best practices and create refactor branches from develop and not from features!

We don't see a need to edit the product backlog as of yet, but we're definitely going to take into account the feedback we received from our sprint review. 
Some of the tasks include:

1. Creating feature files for each backlog requirement and adding @CucumberOptions to the RunCucumberTests.java file
2. Display a proper error message upon registration (not in the eclipse console)
3. UI - center the login page and add the banner, properly display which page a user is on (login vs registration), color scheme
4. Remove one of the two 'passwords don't match' error
5. Add a remote DB for testing purposes
